  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

  <h2>1. Acceptance</h2>
  <p>By downloading or using BASELINE ("the App"), you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

  <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
  <p>BASELINE is a personal dopamine tracking application that provides a daily score based on behaviors you choose to track. The App is designed for personal wellness tracking and does not provide medical advice, diagnoses, or treatment.</p>

  <h2>3. Subscriptions</h2>
  <p>BASELINE offers auto-renewing subscriptions. Payment is charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage and cancel subscriptions in your App Store account settings.</p>

  <h2>4. Free Trial</h2>
  <p>We may offer a free trial period. If you do not cancel before the trial ends, you will be automatically charged the subscription fee. Unused portions of a free trial are forfeited upon purchasing a subscription.</p>

  <h2>5. User Data</h2>
  <p>All personal data (scores, streaks, categories) is stored locally on your device. We do not store your personal tracking data on any server. You are responsible for backing up your device. See our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details on anonymous analytics.</p>

  <h2>6. Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>The App is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. BASELINE is not a medical device and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult a qualified health provider with questions about your health or well-being.</p>

  <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the developers of BASELINE shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the App.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes</h2>
  <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
